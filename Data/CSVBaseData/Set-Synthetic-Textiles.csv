The difference in crimp ratio has caused unevenness in the width direction of a woven fabric. As a solution thereto, in the present invention, the boiling water shrinkage percentage of to-be-inserted additional yarns is set to be lower than that of foundation yarns, so that shrinkage is suppressed in the width-direction end parts of the base fabric, resulting in making it possible to decrease the difference in crimp ratio between the width-direction center and the width-direction end parts of the base fabric, thereby making it possible to produce an airbag base fabric having excellent evenness in the width direction.",TOYO BOSEKI,TAKEUCHI HIROYA,,https://lens.org/002-882-355-351-708,Patent Application,yes,4,0,7,187-523-950-975-835;;011-858-872-803-975;;119-609-125-041-11X;;157-397-857-761-952;;106-978-083-190-345;;125-456-103-704-616;;002-882-355-351-708,WO;;CN;;MX;;EP;;JP;;US,7,187-523-950-975-835;;011-858-872-803-975;;119-609-125-041-11X;;157-397-857-761-952;;106-978-083-190-345;;125-456-103-704-616;;002-882-355-351-708,WO;;CN;;MX;;EP;;JP;;US,0,D03D1/02;;D03D15/567;;B60R21/235;;D03D15/283;;D10B2401/04;;D10B2505/124;;D03D13/008;;D10B2331/02;;B60R2021/23509;;D06C7/02;;D03D15/567;;B60R21/235;;D03D1/02,D03D1/02;;B60R21/235;;D03D5/00;;D03D15/567;;D06C7/00,,1,0,,,See also references of EP 4245903A4,PENDING

The dynamic woven material comprises a plurality of discrete woven cells, where each woven cell comprises a reactive region and a non-reactive region. The reactive region changes from a first physical state to a second physical state when the woven material is exposed to the external stimulus. The woven material may be formed with zonal stretch properties by varying the areas occupied by the reactive region and the non-reactive region in each woven cell. For example, the bigger the area occupied by the reactive region in the woven cells in a particular zone of the dynamic woven material, the higher the level of stretch in the particular zone may be.

One of the yarns may consist of multi-filamentary meta-aramid fiber (e.g. Nomex), the other of either a multi-filamentary or a spun (staple) para-aramid fiber (e.g. Kevlar). The textile material can be visualized as two separate fabrics being interlaced together by the sharing of yarns between them. When used as part of a firefighter or work garment for protection against heat and flame, the outer shell fabric has superior tear resistance, abrasion resistance, UV resistance, and thermal protective performance when compared to other outer shell fabrics used for the same application. In addition, the textile material is more elastic than traditional woven fabrics of the same yarns, and when used in conjunction with a firefighter garment, increases comfort and mobility.",BACOU DAILOZ PROTECTIVE APPARE,BARBEAU CLAUDE;;COCHRAN ROSS,SPERIAN PROTECTIVE APPAREL LTD (2005-09-26);;STX PROTECTIVE APPAREL INC (2003-03-31);;MARCANADA INC (2000-03-10);;160182 CANADA INC (2003-04-02),https://lens.org/118-598-518-481-856,Granted Patent,yes,5,37,4,118-598-518-481-856;;004-306-060-909-011;;093-645-817-748-307;;196-821-985-290-221,WO;;AU;;US,4,118-598-518-481-856;;004-306-060-909-011;;093-645-817-748-307;;196-821-985-290-221,WO;;AU;;US,0,D04B21/16;;A41D31/08;;D03D11/02;;D03D15/513;;D10B2331/021;;Y10S428/92;;Y10S428/921;;Y10T442/322;;Y10T442/3228;;Y10T442/326;;Y10T442/3276;;Y10T442/3976;;Y10T442/3984;;D04B21/16;;A41D31/08;;D03D11/02;;D03D15/513;;D10B2331/021;;Y10S428/92;;Y10S428/921;;Y10T442/322;;Y10T442/3228;;Y10T442/326;;Y10T442/3276;;Y10T442/3976;;Y10T442/3984,A41D31/00;;D03D15/12;;D04B21/00,442/208;;442/213;;442/215;;442/301;;442/302;;442/209;;428/920;;428/921;;169/45;;169/46;;169/47;;169/48;;169/49;;169/50,1,0,,,"Marjory L.
