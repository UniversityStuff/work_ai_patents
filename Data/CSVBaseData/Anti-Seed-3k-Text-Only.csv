The present invention provides dedicated hardware within the logic blocks for performing the carry function quickly and with a minimum number of components. The invention takes advantage of the fact that a carry signal to be added to two bits can be propagated to the next more significant bit when the two binary bits to be added are unequal, and that one of the bits can serve as the carry signal when the bits are equal. For each bit, a carry propagate signal is generated by a lookup table programmable function generator and is used by dedicated hardware to generate the carry signal.",,G06F7/503;;G06F2207/4812;;H03K19/1737;;H03K19/17704;;H03K19/17728;;H03K19/17732;;G06F7/503;;G06F2207/4812;;H03K19/1737;;H03K19/17704;;H03K19/17728;;H03K19/17732;;G06F7/50;;G06F7/503;;G06F7/506;;H03K19/173;;H03K19/177,antiSeed

A main idea is as follows: A task scheduler is connected between a CPU and each hardware accelerator. The task scheduler first obtains a target task (for example, obtains the target task from a memory), and obtains a dependency relationship between the target task and an associated task. When it is determined, based on the dependency relationship, that a first associated task (for example, a prerequisite for executing the target task is that both a task 1 and a task 2 are executed) in the associated task has been executed, it indicates that the target task meets an execution condition, and the task scheduler schedules related hardware accelerators (one or more) to execute the target task. Based on a dependency relationship between tasks, the task scheduler schedules, through hardware scheduling, each hardware accelerator to execute each task, and delivery of each task is performed through direct hardware access. This shortens delay of task delivery, and indirectly improves processing performance of a system.

An objective means is provided for categorizing and quantifying patterns of prescription drug utilization as a health care service within a clinically relevant time frame. A pharmacy episode group (PEG) is a pharmacologically homogenous grouping of drugs with the same therapeutic ingredients used by a patient once or over an extended period of time. The PEG is a patient-centered pharmacy classification unit, which uses script-level pharmacy claim data as input data and assigns each script to the appropriate episode. Pharmacy episodes are categorized based on algorithms linking the pattern of a physician's recommended use (drug supply) and the patient's pattern of compliance (intervals between fill dates). The system also identifies multi-drug and concurrent use drug episodes, flags patients' records where intervals between scripts suggest non-compliance with recommended therapy, selects the most recent claims, resets windows (episode start and end dates), and ultimately assigns all pharmacy claims to episodes.",,G06Q10/087;;G16H20/10;;G16H40/20;;G06Q10/087;;G16H20/10;;G16H40/20;;G16H10/60;;G16H20/10;;G16H40/20,antiSeed

When the switching device (166) switches on the extraction of the charged particle beam circulating through the charged particle accelerator (100) into the irradiation unit (100), the charged particle beam is irradiated on the irradiation target in the irradiation unit. When the switching device switches off the beam extraction from the charged particle accelerator into the irradiation unit, the irradiation of the charged particle beam on the irradiation target is also stopped. Accordingly, when the control unit (130) controls the switching device to cause it to switch on and off the beam extraction, the irradiation on the irradiation target can also be switched on and off. Since the electromagnets (220, 221) set the irradiation point of the charged particle beam in the irradiation unit (110), the charged particle beam extracted from the charged particle accelerator into the irradiation unit can be irradiated on the irradiation target. Since the control unit (130) controls the electromagnets (220, 221) to cause them to change the irradiation point, the charged particle beam can be irradiated on another irradiation point of the irradiation target. Even when the irradiation target has a complicated shape, the irradiation target can be irradiated with high accuracy through simplified control. The irradiation is continued until a target of irradiation dose is reached and therefore, even when the beam intensity changes temporally, the irradiation target can be irradiated with uniform beam density. <IMAGE>",,A61N5/1042;;A61N2005/1074;;A61N2005/1087;;A61N5/10,antiSeed

Since this is an artificial intelligence system, it will be able to learn and save the new edits the doctor makes. It will not be necessary to make this same edit again. As of now, doctors are burdened and exhausted due to the several hours spent writing the operative report.

In one embodiment, foaming is based on a precursor containing crystals of the AlCl3(Pr<i>2O) complex. The decomposition of the initial precursor produces polymerizing species dissolved in liquid isopropyl chloride. The solvent and growing AlOxCly(OPr<i>)z species are mixed homogeneously so that the boiling point of the solution is raised above the boiling point of the pure isopropyl chloride. Polymerization takes place in the liquid until a critical polymer size is attained, whereupon a phase separation into polymer rich and solvent rich regions occurs. Since the expelled solvent is suddenly above its boiling point, bubbles start forming instantly. Foam stabilization takes place as a result of gelation in the polymer rich regions which comprise the cell walls in the foam. The net result of the process is a gelled ultra light foam.",,C04B35/10;;C04B35/5152;;C04B38/0045;;C04B2111/00793;;C04B2111/52;;C04B38/00;;C04B35/10;;C04B35/5152;;C04B38/0045;;C04B2111/00793;;C04B2111/52;;B01J35/56;;C04B38/02;;C04B38/00,antiSeed

Conventionally, a conductive separator plate is made of a carbonaceous material, and therefore the costs such as the fabrication cost are difficult to reduce, and a metallic plate is used on trial instead of a carbonaceous plate. However the metallic plate is exposed to a hot oxidizing atmosphere, and as a result the metallic plate is corroded after a long use, lowering the power generation efficiency gradually. According to the invention, the metallic conductive separator plate is a type in which a conductive coat comprising conductive particles and glass is formed on a surface having a gas passage. Thus, the corrosion of the metallic plate is suppressed and the degradation of the power generation efficiency after long use is also suppressed. <IMAGE>",,H01M8/0226;;H01M8/0206;;H01M8/0215;;H01M8/0228;;H01M2300/0082;;Y02E60/50;;H01M8/02;;H01M8/0226;;H01M8/0206;;H01M8/0215;;H01M8/0228;;H01M2300/0082;;H01M8/02,antiSeed

Specifically, this patent improves the current manual scrolling such as at a constant rate of 0.2 seconds per image slice by establishing triggering events which cause a precise timing system to exactly determine the appropriate amount of time to spend on each image. For example, viewing of homogeneous regions where there is good contrast between a lesion and background will serve as a triggering event for rapid scrolling. In contrast, viewing of heterogeneous and complex regions or regions where the target is similar in gray scale to the background will serve as a triggering event for slow scrolling.",,A61B6/022;;A61B6/025;;A61B6/032;;A61B6/0414;;A61B6/461;;A61B6/465;;A61B6/466;;A61B6/467;;A61B6/502;;A61B2017/00216;;A61B2090/365;;A61B2090/502;;G02B27/0172;;G02B2027/0138;;G02B2027/014;;G06F3/013;;G06F3/0483;;G06F3/04845;;G06F3/0485;;G06F2203/04806;;G06T7/0012;;G06T2207/10112;;G06T2207/30068;;G06T2207/30096;;G16H30/40;;G16H50/20;;G06F3/04845;;A61B34/74;;A61B2034/743;;A61B2034/744;;G06F3/0487;;G06F9/542;;G06F2203/04806;;G06F3/0484;;A61B34/00;;G06F3/0487;;G06F9/54,antiSeed

A catalyst layer formed of a hydrogen storage alloy is provided on one surface of the membrane facing the anode electrode layer. Another catalyst layer formed of platinum-on carbon is provided on the opposite surface of the membrane facing the cathode electrode layer. The catalyst layer on the anode-electrode-layer side dissociates hydrogen gas into atomic hydrogen, diffuses the atomic hydrogen by way of solid phase diffusion, and absorbs/desorbs atomic hydrogen. The catalyst layer on the cathode-electrode-layer side forms hydroxide ions from air, humidifying water, and electrons. The membrane allows movement of the hydroxide ions to the catalyst layer on the anode-electrode-layer side. This leads to formation of water on the anode-electrode-layer side, whereby occurrence of dry-up can be prevented. Even when flooding arises from formed water, atomic hydrogen can smoothly move through solid-phase diffusion. An open circuit voltage of the catalyst layer on the cathode-electrode-layer side can be made smaller than an elution potential of platinum.

The CDR consists of a phase detector, an averaging circuit and a phase interpolator. The phase detector samples each data bit at its midpoint and at its transitional region and then compares the two samples to determine whether the sampling clock, which is generated by a phase interpolator, is leading or lagging the data stream. The averaging circuit filters out the high frequency jitters in the phase detector output and then passes the filtered signals on to the phase interpolator for phase selection. The phase interpolator uses the filtered signals from the averaging circuit as a guide in the selection of an output clock phase that minimizes the phase difference between the output clock and the incoming data.",,H04L7/0337;;H04L7/0025;;H04L7/0337;;H04L7/0025;;H04L7/00;;H03D3/24;;H03L7/06;;H04L7/033,antiSeed

131-211-174-996-283,"Method for estimating rock brittleness from well-log data The invention describes a procedure for determining the shale brittleness index from data obtained in the well by at least three well-logging tools measuring corresponding parameters. Three tools, namely sonic, density and deep resistivity, are selected. The time interval signals from the sonic tool are converted to the P-wave velocity. The product of signals obtained from the sonic and density tools (P-wave velocity×Bulk density=Acoustic impedance (AI)) responds in the same direction to a variation of the volume of water and organic matter (OM) volume of the rocks, whereas the third tool (Deep Resistivity) reacts very differently in response to a change of one or other of these same components, in a three-pole diagram, with rock matrix, OM and water as the three components onto an Acoustic Impedance vs resistivity ratio function plane. The resistivity ratio function is the square root of the ratio between the water resistivity and the measured formation resistivity. The position of the curved matrix-water line with OM=0 fraction by volume is fixed connecting the rock matrix point with that of the water point. The slope of the matrix-water curve is controlled by the tortuosity factor ‘a’ that is selected for a formation zone considering the pore structure, grain size and level of compaction. The data points to be analysed can be calibrated accordingly by iterating the resistivity of water (Rw) and occasionally the tortuosity factor (a) parameter to obtain the Rw value. In a graph where the parameters used depend, for example, on the sonic velocity in the rock, the rock bulk density and on the electric resistivity of the formations, the iso quartz/calcite-content lines are denoted as iso-brittleness line as with an increase in quartz/calcite content, both organic content and porosity decrease, resulting in an increase in brittleness. These iso-brittleness lines form a set of parallel curved lines intersecting the matrix-water reference curved line. Brittleness is derived from that graph corresponding to each pair of values of the parameters measured in the well.",,G01V1/306;;G01V1/32;;G01V1/50;;G01V3/18;;G01V2210/622;;Y02A90/30;;G01V11/00;;E21B49/00;;G01V1/50;;G01V3/20;;G01V2210/1299;;G01V2210/1429;;G01V2210/6169;;G01V2210/6224;;G01V11/00;;E21B49/00;;G01V1/50;;G01V3/20,antiSeed

The present invention also relates to novel zeolite based catalysts used in such methods. The present invention also relates to methods of manufacturing such zeolite based catalysts. Plastics waste is traditionally disposed of by land-fill, incineration or recycling by re- processing the waste into raw material for reuse. Each of these disposal methods has its disadvantages. The drawbacks of land-fill are self apparent. Although incineration may include energy recovery, there still remains the obvious problem of CO2 emission and the emission of other toxic pollutants. Additionally, recycling the plastics requires sorting of the plastics waste because certain types of plastics materials are not recyclable, and mixtures of plastics can be problematic.

Each record can cause plural equations to be loaded and the equations are linked via token pointers. The unrelated equations are linked through input and output pointers. Each intermediate file record can cause record locations for associated input and output tokens to be preassigned. When executing, an input is percolated through the equations until an impasse is encountered. If a branch shape is encountered, a token pointer for a different branch is pushed onto a stack. When an impasse is encountered, the token pointer on the stack is used to continue percolation. Whenever no token pointers remain on the stack and an impasse occurs, another input is brought into the execution table and percolated. When all return stack pointers and inputs have been executed, the system checks for incomplete logic states, assumes a value and continues percolation.

A decision selects either the source data from queue delay profiles or a real-time report. A clustering algorithm is used to assign potentially widely disparate geographic locations to clusters and to assign service type records to a cluster. Calendar-based queue delay profiles may be associated at the cluster level, at the service-type level, and at the individual service point level. Service objects may request an estimated queue delay; service objects may be provided with a estimated queue delay for a specified service point and also delays for alternative service points.

015-990-421-638-193,"METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR A SPARSE DISTRIBUTED MEMORY SYSTEM A computer memory includes K hard memory locations, hereinafter HMLs, each HML having M counters. A reference address element stores a reference address sequence of N bits. A data register stores data as a sequence of M integers. The memory has a processor system for determining a subset of HMLs to access for each reference address during read and write operations. For each HML, the processor system receives a subset of the reference address bits equal in number to q. The subset of reference address bits is chosen by selecting, for each HML, q integers between 1 and N as selected coordinates, hereinafter SCs, each SC corresponding to a bit position within the reference address, and for each SC for each HML, assigning a 0 or 1 as an assigned value for that SC. The processor system then stores the SCs and the assigned values and, for each of the SCs for each of the HMLs, compares the assigned value for the SC with the value of the corresponding bit in the reference address bits. The processor system then accesses those HMLs for which the assigned values for all SCs are identical with the corresponding bits in the subset of the reference address bits. During a write, the processor system combines data in the data register with any data already located in the M counters in each of the accessed HMLs, the M counters in each of the accessed HMLs being used for storing the combined data. The memoryy also has an accumulator system made up of a set of M accumulators with the ith accumulator coupled to receive data from the ith counter, for each accessed HML, so that each of the accumulators accumulates integers from the counters, receiving one integer from the corresponding counter for each accessed HML, thereby obtaining a value Vi in the ith accumulator. The accumulator system can then be used for outputting data corresponding to the values in the accumulators.",,G06F12/02;;G06N20/00;;G06F12/02;;G06N20/00;;G06F12/02;;G06N20/00,antiSeed

The solvent and growing AIOxCIy(OPr<i>)z species are mixed homogeneously so that the boiling point of the solution is raised above the boiling point of the pure isopropyl chloride. Polymerization takes place in the liquid until a critical polymer size is attained, whereupon a phase separation into polymer rich and solvent rich regions occurs.

003-045-140-020-133,"CATALYSTS, METHOD OF PREPARING THESE CATALYSTS AND METHOD OF USING SAID CATALYSTS A catalyst is prepared by combining a first compound consisting of a bis(cyclopentadienyl)metal compound with a second compound which is an ion exchange compound comprising a cation which will irreversibly react with a ligand on said first component and an anion which is a single coordination complex comprising a plurality of lipophilic radicals covalently coordinated to and shielding a central charge-bearing metal or metalloid atom, which anion is bulky and stable to reactions involving the cation of the second component. Upon combination of the first and second components, the cation of the second component reacts with one of the ligands of the first component, thereby generating an ion pair consisting of a Group IV-B metal cation with a formal coordination number of 3 and a valence of +4 and the aforementioned anion, which anion is compatible with and noncoordinating towards the metal cation formed from the first component. Many of the catalyst thus formed are stable and isolable and may be recovered and stored. The catalysts may be preformed and then used to polymerize olefins, diolefins and/or acetylenically unsaturated compounds either alone or in combination with each other or with monomers or the catalysts may be formed in situ during polymerization by adding the separate components to the polymerization reaction. The catalyst will be formed when the two components are combined in a suitable solvent or diluent at a temperature within the range from about -100C to about 300C.",,C07F17/00;;C08F4/65908;;C08F4/65912;;C08F4/65922;;C08F10/00;;C08F110/02;;C08F110/06;;C08F210/06;;C08F210/16;;C08F210/18;;C08F4/64;;C08F4/642;;B01J31/14;;B01J37/00;;C07F7/00;;C07F17/00;;C08F4/00;;C08F4/08;;C08F4/16;;C08F4/60;;C08F4/603;;C08F4/64;;C08F4/643;;C08F4/655;;C08F4/659;;C08F4/6592;;C08F4/76;;C08F10/00;;C08F36/00;;C08F38/00;;C08F110/02;;C08F110/06;;C08F210/06;;C08F210/16;;C08F210/18,antiSeed
