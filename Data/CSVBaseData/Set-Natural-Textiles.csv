CELEC CORPORATION, Ltd., and TOWNSEND, C. S. June 8, 1939, No. 16806. [Class 2 (ii)] Vegetable fibres e.g. sisal fibres are rendered soft and suitable for spinning by subjecting them to treatment with a strong alkaline solution and then with a weak solution of an acid so as to dissolve the gums, resins, and other binding substances, subjecting the separated fibres to treatment with a swelling agent which is a sodium compound e.g. ,sodium hydrosulphite, removing the harsh silicious covering on the swelled fibres by frictional rubbing, and then softening the fibres by treatment with a wetting agent e.g. a solution of a sulphonated oil. The raw fibres may be boiled in a strong solution of sodium carbonate and then soaked in a 1 per cent solution of sulphuric acid at normal temperature. The separated fibres may then be boiled in a weak solution of sodium hydrosulphite and soda ash whereby they are swollen and also bleached. The frictional rubbing may be effected by passing the fibres on to a rotary disc which operates by an oscillatory movement, the disc being finely channelled radially. The fibres are passed over the disc by means of a conveyer belt which may also be finely channelled. The fibres may be softened by soaking them in an aqueous solution of sulphonated castor oil heated to about 90C. The sodium carbonate solution used in the first stage of the treatment may be rendered caustic by the addition of lime. The liquors used may be filtered, made up to the required strength by addition of fresh reagents, and then used over again for treating a fresh batch of fibres.",CELEC CORP LTD;;CHARLES SAMUEL TOWNSEND,,,https://lens.org/030-530-070-052-831,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,030-530-070-052-831,GB,1,030-530-070-052-831,GB,0,D01C1/02,D01C1/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The finish has improved fastness to alkalies, washing and UV light. The process may be carried out simultaneously with dyeing, e.g. with acid levelling or 1:1 premetallised dyes. The tungsten complex is preferably an isopolytungstate or heteropolytungstate formed by acidifying an aqueous solution of sodium tungstate, with e.g. phosphoric, boric, formic, citric, oxalic, or tartaric acid (formation of heteropolytungstate). The solution is preferably applied at a temperature of at least 30C for at least 10 minutes. The zirconium or titanium complex may be a fluoro-, carboxylato-, or hydroxycarboxylato zirconate or titanate. The treatment may be applied to natural polyamides, e.g. wool, silk, alpaca, cashmere, mohair, leather or natural hair, e.g. wigs, and particularly to wool in blends containing less than 85% wool, e.g. with rayon. nylon, polyester, or polyacrylic and to wool which has been subjected to a resin treatment, e.g. with a blocked isocyanate, a polyamineepichlorohydrin resin or a silicone. The wool fibres may also be blended with asbestos. glass or ""Nomex"" (RTM) fibres. The material may be in_the form of yarn, or woven, knitted or pile fabric.

The treated material is preferably substantially completely soluble in 0.01% to 3.0% sodium hydroxide. The alkali soluble property may be obtained by treating the cellulose acetate textile material with a dichromate and a mineral acid; e.g. sodium dichromate of 0.7 to 4.0% concentration and nitric acid of approximately 1.0 to 18% by weight concentration. Alternatively the alkali soluble property may be obtained by treating the cellulose acetate material with chromic acid and oxalic acid. In an example a cellulose acetate cloth is treated for 60 minutes at 170 DEG F. at a liquid to fibre ratio of 20:1 with a solution containing 0.8% sodium dichromate expressed as the dihydrate, and 2.4% nitric acid expressed as 100% nitric acid.ALSO:Alkali soluble cellulose acetate textile material that is at least 90% soluble in an alkaline solution at room temperature, but possesses the necessary physical properties for effective use as textile fibre, yarn or fabric and may be dissolved and easily removed from textile material containing this treated cellulose acetate as one component and other textile components that are not alkali soluble, is made by treating non-alkali soluble cellulose acetate textile material with a composition comprising (1) either chromic acid or a dichromate salt in combination with (2) either a mineral acid or certain organic acids e.g. oxalic acid for sufficient length of time to render the cellulose acetate material soluble in alkali washing the material free of the treating chemical and drying the material.

The alkali soluble cellulose acetate of the invention may be used for the production of non-puckering fabrics. Differences in contraction of adjacent portions of fabrics, e.g. the main body portion and the decorative border portion respectively of a water absorbent towel, may be avoided by using a special fabric yarn in the border portion. This yarn is purposely spiralled or coiled to provide excess length which becomes useful when effective upon wetting of the yarns and straightening out of the coils or spirals. To enable the coiled or spiralled yarn, usually the filling yarn in the woven fabric to be woven satisfactorily in the decorative border using conventional weaving equipment, a temporary core yarn is employed around which the filling yarn is coiled or spiralled, the core yarn acting as a carrying medium for the spiralled or coiled yarn. It is necessary for this core yarn to be easily removed and preferably by the use of liquid or solutions commonly employed in towel or fabric finishing. One of the important commercial advantages of the cellulose acetate yarn of the present invention is that it is relatively inexpensive and is a readily available commodity in fibre, yarn or fabric form, and its processing in accordance with the present invention to render it alkali soluble, is relatively inexpensive. The alkali soluble material of the present invention may also be used in the manufacture of lace.

The coarse fibres reduce the market value of bulk fibre intended for apparel textiles. Silk and cashmere wool are considered to be exclusive, as they have a pleasant soft touch. This is a result of small fibre diameter. Raw cashmere normally under goes manual dehairing to remove the coarse guard hairs prior to apparel manufacture. Mechanisation has had limited success and to date only an extended carder is available for cashmere and other wool products, but it damages some of the fibres and only partially reduces the number of guard hairs. The operator is unable to choose the diameter of the two streams. The described invention utilises gravity and electrostatic forces to divide the bulk fibre into multiple streams of specific diameters, as required. The invention can be used for any clean and free fibres including animal, plant and blast fibres.

The acid sulphite solution may be circulated around the material being treated at a pH of 6 or may be applied at a pH of about 8 in small amounts which react with the material and are reduced to a pH of about 6. In an example hair after a preliminary shampoo is treated with a half molar solution of sodium metabisulphite and sulphite in water containing 5 per cent of alcohol, the proportion of sulphite and metabisulphite being such as to give a pH of 6. The solution is circulated about the hair wound on a curler for about 15 minutes as a temperature of 50--60 DEG C. If preferred a 12 per cent sodium sulphite solution to which metabisulphite has been added to attain a pH of 8 may be used without circulation. In either case after the treatment, with the hair still preferably on the curler a solution of an aldehyde or a ketone, e.g. 60 per cent acetone is applied for 2--3 minutes to combine with the excess bisulphite. Treatment with a mild oxidizing agent, e.g. a 2--10 volumes hydrogen peroxide solution, preferably made acid, a percarbonate perborate or persulphate may follow or replace the treatment with aldehyde or ketone. Ordinary washing and finishing treatments follow. If desired a thickening agent such as agar-agar or kieselguhr may be added to the reducing solution to form a paste with which the hair is formed into waves or curls on the head. Suitable wetting agents may also be added to the paste, which is left in contact with the hair for about 15 minutes and then raised to a temperature of about 50 DEG C., e.g. by a stream of hot air (the hair being covered with a water impermeable cap) to set the waves or curls. Alternatively the hair may be formed into waves or curls and then treated with the reducing solution. The reagents may be applied by spraying. The treatment may be used in place of the usual crabbing or blowing treatments of wool, for the removal of distortion in knitted fabrics due to uneven stress in the yarn or yarns for the manufacture of curl fabrics or artificial astrakhan and persian lamb fabrics may be permanently set by the method of the invention.",JOHN BAMBER SPEAKMAN,,,https://lens.org/005-486-538-727-442,Granted Patent,no,0,1,8,013-192-865-499-535;;116-077-520-367-917;;005-486-538-727-442;;182-396-004-087-224;;003-582-992-810-550;;122-737-484-227-033;;145-989-916-652-566;;124-607-019-751-46X,FR;;GB;;BE;;US;;NL,9,013-192-865-499-535;;116-077-520-367-917;;005-486-538-727-442;;182-396-004-087-224;;003-582-992-810-550;;122-737-484-227-033;;175-113-996-145-477;;145-989-916-652-566;;124-607-019-751-46X,FR;;GB;;BE;;US;;NL,0,A61Q5/04;;A61K8/23;;A61K8/447;;D01C3/00;;A61Q5/04;;A61K8/23;;A61K8/447;;D01C3/00,A45D20/40;;A61K8/23;;A61K8/44;;A61Q5/04;;C07K14/78;;D01C3/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
