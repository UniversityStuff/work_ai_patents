[Class 2 (ii)] Vegetable fibres e.g. sisal fibres are rendered soft and suitable for spinning by subjecting them to treatment with a strong alkaline solution and then with a weak solution of an acid so as to dissolve the gums, resins, and other binding substances, subjecting the separated fibres to treatment with a swelling agent which is a sodium compound e.g. ,sodium hydrosulphite, removing the harsh silicious covering on the swelled fibres by frictional rubbing, and then softening the fibres by treatment with a wetting agent e.g. a solution of a sulphonated oil. The raw fibres may be boiled in a strong solution of sodium carbonate and then soaked in a 1 per cent solution of sulphuric acid at normal temperature. The separated fibres may then be boiled in a weak solution of sodium hydrosulphite and soda ash whereby they are swollen and also bleached. The frictional rubbing may be effected by passing the fibres on to a rotary disc which operates by an oscillatory movement, the disc being finely channelled radially. The fibres are passed over the disc by means of a conveyer belt which may also be finely channelled. The fibres may be softened by soaking them in an aqueous solution of sulphonated castor oil heated to about 90C. The sodium carbonate solution used in the first stage of the treatment may be rendered caustic by the addition of lime. The liquors used may be filtered, made up to the required strength by addition of fresh reagents, and then used over again for treating a fresh batch of fibres.",,D01C1/02;;D01C1/02,naturalTextiles

The finish has improved fastness to alkalies, washing and UV light. The process may be carried out simultaneously with dyeing, e.g. with acid levelling or 1:1 premetallised dyes. The tungsten complex is preferably an isopolytungstate or heteropolytungstate formed by acidifying an aqueous solution of sodium tungstate, with e.g. phosphoric, boric, formic, citric, oxalic, or tartaric acid (formation of heteropolytungstate). The solution is preferably applied at a temperature of at least 30C for at least 10 minutes. The zirconium or titanium complex may be a fluoro-, carboxylato-, or hydroxycarboxylato zirconate or titanate. The treatment may be applied to natural polyamides, e.g. wool, silk, alpaca, cashmere, mohair, leather or natural hair, e.g. wigs, and particularly to wool in blends containing less than 85% wool, e.g. with rayon. nylon, polyester, or polyacrylic and to wool which has been subjected to a resin treatment, e.g. with a blocked isocyanate, a polyamineepichlorohydrin resin or a silicone.

The alkali soluble cellulose acetate of the invention may be used for the production of non-puckering fabrics. Differences in contraction of adjacent portions of fabrics, e.g. the main body portion and the decorative border portion respectively of a water absorbent towel, may be avoided by using a special fabric yarn in the border portion. This yarn is purposely spiralled or coiled to provide excess length which becomes useful when effective upon wetting of the yarns and straightening out of the coils or spirals. To enable the coiled or spiralled yarn, usually the filling yarn in the woven fabric to be woven satisfactorily in the decorative border using conventional weaving equipment, a temporary core yarn is employed around which the filling yarn is coiled or spiralled, the core yarn acting as a carrying medium for the spiralled or coiled yarn. It is necessary for this core yarn to be easily removed and preferably by the use of liquid or solutions commonly employed in towel or fabric finishing. One of the important commercial advantages of the cellulose acetate yarn of the present invention is that it is relatively inexpensive and is a readily available commodity in fibre, yarn or fabric form, and its processing in accordance with the present invention to render it alkali soluble, is relatively inexpensive.

005-486-538-727-442,"Improvements in and relating to the treatment of fibres or fibrous materials containing keratin A method of removing stress from or applying a set to fibrous substances containing keratin such as wool or hair comprises treating the fibrous substances with an acid sulphite solution at temperatures of about 50--60 DEG C. and under such conditions that the solution in contact with the fibrous substances is at approximately pH6 whereby there is obtained a disruption of the constituent disulphide or cystine bonds of keratin and a relief of any stress in the fibres followed by the formation of further linkages in or between the fibre molecules. The acid sulphite solution may be circulated around the material being treated at a pH of 6 or may be applied at a pH of about 8 in small amounts which react with the material and are reduced to a pH of about 6. In an example hair after a preliminary shampoo is treated with a half molar solution of sodium metabisulphite and sulphite in water containing 5 per cent of alcohol, the proportion of sulphite and metabisulphite being such as to give a pH of 6. The solution is circulated about the hair wound on a curler for about 15 minutes as a temperature of 50--60 DEG C. If preferred a 12 per cent sodium sulphite solution to which metabisulphite has been added to attain a pH of 8 may be used without circulation. In either case after the treatment, with the hair still preferably on the curler a solution of an aldehyde or a ketone, e.g. 60 per cent acetone is applied for 2--3 minutes to combine with the excess bisulphite. Treatment with a mild oxidizing agent, e.g. a 2--10 volumes hydrogen peroxide solution, preferably made acid, a percarbonate perborate or persulphate may follow or replace the treatment with aldehyde or ketone. Ordinary washing and finishing treatments follow. If desired a thickening agent such as agar-agar or kieselguhr may be added to the reducing solution to form a paste with which the hair is formed into waves or curls on the head. Suitable wetting agents may also be added to the paste, which is left in contact with the hair for about 15 minutes and then raised to a temperature of about 50 DEG C., e.g. by a stream of hot air (the hair being covered with a water impermeable cap) to set the waves or curls. Alternatively the hair may be formed into waves or curls and then treated with the reducing solution. The reagents may be applied by spraying.
