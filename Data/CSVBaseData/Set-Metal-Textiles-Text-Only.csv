The metal compound is then exposed to a nitrogen atmosphere and the temperature is raised to a temperature higher than that at which the metal compound thermally decomposes to precipitate the metal. As a result, the metallic particles metallically bond with each other, the internal voids and surface irregularities are filled by a collection of metallically bonded metallic particles, and the surface is covered by a collection of metallically bonded metallic particles, producing fibers, threads, woven fabrics, or nonwoven fabrics with metallic properties.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 2",,;;D06M11/83,metalTextiles

Also, the present invention can be woven into a fabric for winter clothes requiring elasticity and can be produced into a wire (for example, earphone wire) requiring elasticity while preventing a short circuit caused by tension. Also, the present invention can be woven into a fabric for clothes requiring a metal effect as well as elasticity and heat generation.

SOLUTION: This blended woven fabric is obtained by weaving twisted metallic yarns and other kind of twisted yarns consisting of another kind of fibrous material. The twisted metallic yarn is formed by the following process : a continuous metallic fiber bundle 5-20μm in metallic fiber diameter and 100-2,000 in the number of the metallic fibers is helically and plastically deformed without any torsion. A plurality of the metallic fiber bundles are then unidirectionally twisted so as to be 2-10mm in twist pitch.

175-385-729-694-42X,"Method for producing metal nanofibers, yarns and textiles A method for fabrication of nanometer scale metal fibers, followed by optional further processing into cables, yarns and textiles composed of the primary nanofibers. A multicomponent composite is first formed by drilling a billet of matrix metal, and inserting rods of the metal desired as nanofibers. Hexed or round rods can also be inserted into a matrix metal can. The diameter of this composite is then reduced by mechanical deformation methods. This composite is then cut to shorter lengths and reinserted into another billet of matrix metal, and again the diameter is reduced by mechanical deformation. This process of large scale metal stacking followed by mechanical deformation is repeated until the desired fiber size scale is reached, the fibers being contained in the matrix metal. After size reduction, the composite metal wires may be further processed into built up configurations, depending on intended application, by stranding, cabling, braiding, weaving, knitting, felting, etc., to form yarns or textiles. After the built up configuration is formed, the matrix metal is removed by chemical etching, leaving a cable, yarn or textile composed of the primary nanofibers.",,B21C33/002;;B21C37/047;;B82Y30/00;;Y10S977/888;;Y10S977/762;;Y10S977/84;;Y10T29/49014;;Y10T29/49826;;Y10T29/49801;;Y10T29/49885;;Y10T29/49812;;Y10T29/49014;;Y10T29/49826;;Y10T29/49801;;Y10T29/49885;;Y10T29/49812;;B21C37/047;;B21C33/002;;B82Y30/00;;Y10S977/888;;Y10S977/84;;Y10S977/762;;B23P25/00;;B23P11/00;;H10N60/01,metalTextiles
