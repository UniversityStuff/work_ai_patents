More specifically, the present invention provides an impregnation apparatus of a fiber sheet for repair and reinforcement and an impregnation method using the same, wherein the impregnation apparatus of the fiber sheet for repair and reinforcement, as an impregnation apparatus for impregnating the fiber sheet with a reinforcing agent, comprises: an impregnation tank which has a filling space to fill the reinforcing agent therein, and has an outlet through which the reinforcing agent is discharged; a reinforcing agent supply unit which supplies the reinforcing agent to the impregnation tank; and a vacuum pump which maintains a vacuum state within the impregnation tank having the reinforcing agent filled therein. The reinforcing agent supply unit includes: a supply tank in which the reinforcing agent is filled; a transfer pipe which guides the reinforcing agent discharged from the supply tank; and a needle unit which receives the reinforcing agent transferred from the transfer pipe and supplies the reinforcing agent to the impregnation tank. The needle unit includes: a needle pipe which connects the transfer pipe and the supply tank; and a transfer unit including a driving motor and a transfer screw which is disposed within the needle pipe to transfer the reinforcing agent. The impregnation apparatus according to the present invention prevents a problem that the circulation pipe or the circulation tank has to be periodically maintained or replaced due to a problem of existing technology that the reinforcing agent is cured while the reinforcing agent is being stuck to an inner surface of a circulation pipe or a circulation tank in the circulation process by circulating the reinforcing agent to be filled in the impregnation tank, thereby enabling the reinforcing agent to be supplied through the needle unit of the reinforcing agent supply unit without resupplying the reinforcing agent. Further, the impregnation apparatus according to the present invention has an effect that vibration generated by a vibration unit installed in the impregnation tank not only removes bubbles of the reinforcing agent, but also enables the fiber sheet to be impregnated with the reinforcing agent uniformly and promptly.",I AND L CO LTD;;GORYEO C&C CO LTD;;LEE DONG WOO,KWON YOUNG IL;;LEE DONG WOO,,https://lens.org/078-877-699-399-626,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,078-877-699-399-626,KR,1,078-877-699-399-626,KR,0,B29C70/443;;B29C70/18;;E04C5/07,B29C70/44;;B29C70/18;;E04C5/07,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
